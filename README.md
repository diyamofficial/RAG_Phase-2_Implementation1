# RAG Internship Project – Retrieval Augmented Generation Pipeline

An end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built using LangChain, LangGraph, Groq LLMs, embeddings, and ChromaDB for context-aware question answering and evaluation. This repository documents the full progression of the project — from foundational RAG concepts (Phase 1) to a production-style, optimized RAG pipeline (Phase 2) with formal evaluation using RAGAS.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 – RAG Basics
`RAG_Phase1_Basics.ipynb`
Covers the fundamentals of building a RAG system: document loading, basic chunking, embeddings, vector storage, and simple retrieval + generation.

### Phase 2 – Optimized RAG Pipeline
`Phase2_RAG_beforeImprovement.ipynb` → `RAG_Optimized_Final.ipynb`
Builds on Phase 1 with an improved, LangGraph-orchestrated pipeline, better chunking/retrieval strategies, Groq LLM integration, and a hybrid retrieval approach. Includes a before/after notebook pair showing the baseline pipeline and the final optimized version.

### Evaluation
`evaluation_results/`
Contains the RAGAS-based evaluation comparing the baseline pipeline against the hybrid/optimized pipeline.

## Workflow Overview

1. Load and preprocess documents
2. Split documents into chunks
3. Generate vector embeddings
4. Store embeddings in ChromaDB
5. Retrieve relevant context based on user queries (baseline and hybrid strategies)
6. Generate responses using Groq LLM
7. Evaluate generated responses using RAGAS and LLM-based judging
8. Compare baseline vs. optimized pipeline performance

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_LINK>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure API Keys

Set the following environment variables or Colab secrets:

* `GROQ_API_KEY`
* `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

---

## Running the Project

Run the notebooks in order:

1. `RAG_Phase1_Basics.ipynb` – foundational pipeline
2. `Phase2_RAG_beforeImprovement.ipynb` – baseline Phase 2 pipeline
3. `RAG_Optimized_Final.ipynb` – final optimized/hybrid pipeline

Run all cells sequentially in each notebook to execute the complete RAG workflow. Evaluation outputs are stored in `evaluation_results/`.

---

## Evaluation

The project includes both a RAGAS-based evaluation and an LLM-as-a-Judge approach to assess:

* Answer Relevancy
* Faithfulness
* Context Precision / Recall
* Context Alignment

Results comparing the baseline pipeline to the hybrid/optimized pipeline are available in `evaluation_results/`, including CSV score files, a comparison table, and a bar plot visualization.
